pasteboard.cpp
---------------

Little app analogous to `pbpaste` on Mac OS X. Best used with `gist.`

Lots of thanks to DeadYak in #haiku-dev

note to self: compile with `g++ pasteboard.cpp -lbe -O3 -o pbpaste`


haikunotify.py
--------------

Python hacks to connect to 	`notify` needs some OOP love eventually but otherwise useful.
